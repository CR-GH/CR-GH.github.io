      <h2>IST 110 - Portfolio</h2>
      <p>This is my portfolio for the final project of IST 110.</p>
      <br>

      <h3>An Introduction to IST</h3>
      <p>The first lesson in this course introduces a variety of concepts related to different areas of IST. We learned a variety of skills,
      ranging from how to use word processor and presentation apps to how to avoid the negative health effects extensive usage of computers can sometimes cause.
      This lesson also teaches some basic aspects of file compression, showing how text and media files are compressed using different methods.</p>

      <h3>A History of IST</h3>
      <p>This second lesson dives more into the history of IST, explaining when the very first computers and related systems were created as well as introducing some of the people who helped create them.
      Additionally, the lesson introduces the basics of how computers function, including teaching how computers translate human-readable code to binary code so that it can be interpreted.</p>

      <h3>Computing Concepts</h3>
      <p>The third lesson includes more information on how computers work, this time teaching the basics of how computers break down and solve complex problems.
      This lesson introduces four key concepts, those being Decomposition (where one complex problem is divided into multiple simpler steps), Pattern Recognition
      (where similar aspects of different problems are identified), Algorithms (where a sequence of steps to solve a particular problem is created), and Abstraction
      (where a solution is generalized so that it can be applied to multiple problems).</p>

      <h3>Computer Hardware</h3>
      <p>In this fourth lesson, the various kinds of computer hardware are introduced. The appearances and functions of components such as the CPU, GPU,
      memory, and others are taught, helping to lay the foundations for valuable skills such as building, disassembling, and troubleshooting various types of computers.</p>

      <h3>Operating Systems</h3>
      <p>Moving on from a computer's hardware, the fifth lesson introduces one of a computer's most critical software components--its operating system. This lesson teaches the basics of
      how these OSes function and the roles they play in linking each hardware component into one complete machine, as well as giving the histories of a few popular operating systems
      including Windows, MacOS, and Linux.</p>

      <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
      <p>Now moving on from a computer's hardware and software components, this lesson teaches about the language a computer speaks. Building on the basics of binary machine language
      that were introduced earlier, this lesson demonstrates how commands are sent to a computer using such a deceptively simple language; then, increasingly higher-level languages
      such as assembly and Python are introduced, teaching how these human-readable languages are translated into machine-readable ones as well as the pros and cons of more abstracted languages.</p>

      <h3>Data Organization</h3>
      <p>This lesson introduces various concepts relating to data organization, including how data is stored in databases and the various impacts these databases can have.
      Students are taught the definitions of terms such as fields, records, and tables, are taught how to insert, delete, and otherwise manipulate data in a table using languages such
      as SQL, and are taught how the introduction of large databases containing personal data can be both helpful and harmful for society.</p>

      <h3>Applications and E-mail</h3>
      <p>In this lesson, students are taught about the various applications and uses of computers. The uses of applications such as audio players, video players, e-mail and text messaging apps,
      and a few others are introduced alongside the basics of how they work, as well as various websites or web applications such as social media, streaming, and blog sites.</p>

      <h3>Security Concepts</h3>
      <p>This lesson teaches about security issues relating to our daily use of computers. Various types of malware such as viruses, worms, trojans, and others are introduced, as well
      as ways to combat them such as careful usage of email applications and utilization of antivirus software. Other forms of security vulnerabilities are also discussed, including
      issues such as Denial of Service attacks and data breaches.</p>

      <h3>The Internet</h3>
      <p>This lesson goes into more detail on the Internet and the World Wide Web. A wide variety of concepts are discussed in this lesson, such as different hardware components that
      enable Internet access, the importance of IP addresses in accessing and interacting with the Internet, and the functions of HTML and other website-related programming languages
      such as CSS and JavaScript.</p>

      <h3>Privacy in a Digital World</h3>
      <p>In this lesson, the issue of privacy on the Internet is introduced. A discussion is given on why privacy and one's "digital footprint" is important, as well as how the
      database technologies mentioned earlier in Lesson 7 can cause issues for those wishing to maintain their privacy and anonymity over the Internet.</p>

      <h3>IST and Society</h3>
      <p>In Lesson 12, the various societal issues IST can bring about are introduced. Concepts like the "digital divide," where financial and educational differences in a population
      can potentially limit access to some technology and create a divide between those who do have this access and those who are unable to do so, are explained. Additionally, the issue
      of cybercrime and how various aspects of the Internet such as anonymity can further complicate this issue is discussed in this lesson.</p>

      <h3>IST and Businesses</h3>
      <p>Moving on from the societal dilemmas of IST, this lesson focuses on more business-related issues. For instance, the issue of copyright and how it can be complicated by various
      aspects of the Internet is discussed, as well as the pros and cons of various forms of work that can be conducted online including in-house work, outsourcing, and crowdsourcing.
      The lesson also gives a short history on a few major e-commerce sites, such as Amazon, Craigslist, and Alibaba.</p>
