      <h1>IST 110 - Portfolio</h1>
      <p>This is my portfolio for the final project of IST 110.</p>
      <br>

      <h2>An Introduction to IST</h2>
      <p>The first lesson in this course introduces a variety of concepts related to different areas of IST. We learned a variety of skills,
      ranging from how to use word processor and presentation apps to how to avoid the negative health effects extensive usage of computers can sometimes cause.
      This lesson also teaches some basic aspects of file compression, showing how text and media files are compressed using different methods.</p>

      <h2>A History of IST</h2>
      <p>This second lesson dives more into the history of IST, explaining when the very first computers and related systems were created as well as introducing some of the people who helped create them.
      Additionally, the lesson introduces the basics of how computers function, including teaching how computers translate human-readable code to binary code so that it can be interpreted.</p>

      <h2>Computing Concepts</h2>
      <p>The third lesson includes more information on how computers work, this time teaching the basics of how computers break down and solve complex problems.
      This lesson introduces four key concepts, those being Decomposition (where one complex problem is divided into multiple simpler steps), Pattern Recognition
      (where similar aspects of different problems are identified), Algorithms (where a sequence of steps to solve a particular problem is created), and Abstraction
      (where a solution is generalized so that it can be applied to multiple problems).</p>

      <h2>Computer Hardware</h2>
      <p>In this fourth lesson, the various kinds of computer hardware are introduced. The appearances and functions of components such as the CPU, GPU,
      memory, and others are taught, helping to lay the foundations for valuable skills such as building, disassembling, and troubleshooting various types of computers.</p>

      <h2>Operating Systems</h2>
      <p>Moving on from a computer's hardware, the fifth lesson introduces one of a computer's most critical software components--its operating system. This lesson teaches the basics of
      how these OSes function and the roles they play in linking each hardware component into one complete machine, as well as giving the histories of a few popular operating systems
      including Windows, MacOS, and Linux.</p>

      <h2>Programming Languages</h2>
      <p>Now moving on from a computer's hardware and software components, this lesson teaches about the language a computer speaks. Building on the basics of binary machine language
      that were introduced earlier, this lesson demonstrates how commands are sent to a computer using such a deceptively simple language; then, increasingly higher-level languages
      such as assembly and Python are introduced, teaching how these human-readable languages are translated into machine-readable ones as well as the pros and cons of more abstracted languages.</p>
