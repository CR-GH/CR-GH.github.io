      <h3>An Introduction to IST</h3>
      <p>The first lesson in this course introduces a variety of concepts related to different areas of IST. We learned a variety of skills,
      ranging from how to use word processor and presentation apps to how to avoid the negative health effects extensive usage of computers can sometimes cause.
      This lesson also teaches some basic aspects of file compression, showing how text and media files are compressed using different methods.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Project Showcase - Virtual Information Treasure Hunt</h4>
          <p>One project I completed for this first lesson was the Virtual Information Treasure Hunt. The goal of this project was to utilize the PSU Library tool to locate a scholarly
          article on the topic of "information overload," then write a short summary of the article as well as include a section discussing how credible the article seems to be. I was
          able to use the PSU Library site to find an article titled "Information Overload in Organization: Impact on Decision Making and Influencing Strategies," which I determined
          to be mostly trustworthy as it seemed to be unbiased, though it could also be outdated as it had been published several years ago.</p>

      <div class="main_section">
      <h3>A History of IST</h3>
      <p>This second lesson dives more into the history of IST, explaining when the very first computers and related systems were created as well as introducing some of the people who helped create them.
      Additionally, the lesson introduces the basics of how computers function, including teaching how computers translate human-readable code to binary code so that it can be interpreted.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Project Showcase - Binary Statements</h4>
          <p>For this project, we were tasked with analyzing three strings of binary code, then using a conversion table to translate these codes into human-readable messages. Using a table provided
          in the reading as well as looking up additional supplementary tables for symbols that were not included, I was able to translate the binary string "01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111"
          into the human-readable message "Hello," the string "01010100 01101000 01101001 01110011 00100000 01101001 01110011 00100000 01100001 00100000 01100010 01101001 01101110 01100001 01110010 01111001 00100000 01100011 01101111 01100100 01100101"
          into the message "This is a binary code," and the string "01001001 00100000 01101100 01101111 01110110 01100101 00100000 01100100 01100001 01110100 01100001 00001010 00001010" into the message "I love data."</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Project Showcase - Binary Representation</h4>
          <p>This lesson also contained another project, the Binary Representation Project, which added onto our understanding of translating binary code to human-readable language by exploring
          how it can also be converted into decimal numbers. For my project, I noticed and wrote about some of the intriguing patterns I noticed with binary numbers, such as a predictable
          pattern that could allow one to "count" in binary.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

      <div class="main_section">
      <h3>Computing Concepts</h3>
      <p>The third lesson includes more information on how computers work, this time teaching the basics of how computers break down and solve complex problems.
      This lesson introduces four key concepts, those being Decomposition (where one complex problem is divided into multiple simpler steps), Pattern Recognition
      (where similar aspects of different problems are identified), Algorithms (where a sequence of steps to solve a particular problem is created), and Abstraction
      (where a solution is generalized so that it can be applied to multiple problems).</p>
      <br>
      <img src="ComputationalConcepts_IMG.png">
      <h4>Project Showcase - Data Analytics</h4>
          <p>This project, a discussion on the topic of Data Analytics, allowed us to strengthen our understanding of the week's lesson by identifying points of confusion and
              sharing them with the class to give others the opportunity to help clarify these questions. For my submission, I asked about how descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive
              analyses were typically performed in a business environment, then received an example from a peer of how these processes can occur in repair facilities.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Project Showcase - Computational Concepts Infographic</h4>
          <p>For this lesson's project, I used Adobe Express to create the infographic shown here, which attempts to visually explain the four computational problem-solving concepts.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

      <div class="main_section">
      <h3>Computer Hardware</h3>
      <p>In this fourth lesson, the various kinds of computer hardware are introduced. The appearances and functions of components such as the CPU, GPU,
      memory, and others are taught, helping to lay the foundations for valuable skills such as building, disassembling, and troubleshooting various types of computers.</p>
      <br>
      <img src="HardwareDissectionLab_IMG.PNG">
      <h4>Project Showcase - Hardware</h4>
          <p>For this discussion project, I attempted to list and explain the functions of various hardware components ranging from the CPU to the cooling fans, as well as reflecting on
             the evolution of computer hardware during my lifetime. I reflected on the differences between the very first desktop computers I used to the desktop I use today, as well as
             noting intriguing similarities between the appearance of my old computer's CPU and that of my current machine.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Project Showcase - Hardware Dissection Lab</h4>
          <p>For this project, I visited the iFixit website to view teardowns of two different kinds of computers, creating a presentation that identifies the various
          components of each of these devices. Shown here is an example of one of these presentation slides.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

      <div class="main_section">
      <h3>Operating Systems</h3>
      <p>Moving on from a computer's hardware, the fifth lesson introduces one of a computer's most critical software components--its operating system. This lesson teaches the basics of
      how these OSes function and the roles they play in linking each hardware component into one complete machine, as well as giving the histories of a few popular operating systems
      including Windows, MacOS, and Linux.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Project Showcase - Operating System</h4>
           <p>This project has a much more humorous premise, involving reflecting on the benefits or downsides operating systems or applications can bring to users by writing a short letter
              addressed to one of these programs. For my submission, I wrote a letter of admiration for the application Blender 3D, commenting on my appreciation for the program's versatility,
              helpful community, and affordability.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Project Showcase - Choose the Best OS</h4>
          <p>For this project, short descriptions were given of three companies which each had different needs but which all needed to choose an operating system best suited for their organization.
          Using what I had learned about the three most popular operating systems, I decided that Linux would be the best OS for a nonprofit social service organization as it was the most affordable,
          that MacOS would be the best OS for an interior design firm due to it being optimized for several popular design applications, and that Windows would be the best OS for a social media
          advertising agency as it is versatile enough to handle the variety of tasks involved in marketing.</p>
      </div>

      <br>
      <br>

      <div class="main_section">
      <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
      <p>Now moving on from a computer's hardware and software components, this lesson teaches about the language a computer speaks. Building on the basics of binary machine language
      that were introduced earlier, this lesson demonstrates how commands are sent to a computer using such a deceptively simple language; then, increasingly higher-level languages
      such as assembly and Python are introduced, teaching how these human-readable languages are translated into machine-readable ones as well as the pros and cons of more abstracted languages.</p>
      <br>
      <img src="PythonProgramming_IMG.PNG">
      <h4>Project Showcase - Programming Languages</h4>
           <p>For this lesson's discussion project, I reflected on the different kinds of programming languages, exploring the benefits and downsides of lower-level languages such as binary and assembly
              and higher-level languages such as Python. For my project, I found that while abstracted languages such as Python do have the significant benefit of being human-readable, the processes of
              converting these languages into binary code that the computer can understand does also have impacts on the application's efficiency.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Project Showcase - Python Programming</h4>
          <p>The project for this lesson was to complete the first three modules of the "Disease Epidemic" activity from the Grok Learning website. Shown here are the outputs I received after
          running my code for each of the three modules.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

      <div class="main_section">
      <h3>Data Organization</h3>
      <p>This lesson introduces various concepts relating to data organization, including how data is stored in databases and the various impacts these databases can have.
      Students are taught the definitions of terms such as fields, records, and tables, are taught how to insert, delete, and otherwise manipulate data in a table using languages such
      as SQL, and are taught how the introduction of large databases containing personal data can be both helpful and harmful for society.</p>
      <br>
      <img src="SQL_IMG.PNG">
      <h4>Project Showcase - Data Organization</h4>
           <p>For this discussion, our goal was to explore the functionality and uses of Excel macros. For my project, I analyzed the functionality of a macro called "Apply Conditional Formatting";
              I found that the macro serves to allow a complex style (such as one containing fonts, font styles, and background and text colors) to be defined and saved, so it can be quickly applied
              at any time. I also analyzed some of the security risks that could arise with this macro and with Excel macros in general, such as that malicious code could be included in a script for
              a macro and could be unknowingly run by a user when the script is added to their own document.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Project Showcase - Music Genome Project</h4>
          <p>Our goal for this project was to explore Pandora Internet Radio's "Music Genome Project," a project that utilizes database technology to attempt to learn a user's music preferences, using them to
             recommend music these users may like and avoid playing music they may not be as receptive to. I tested the effectiveness of the project by selecting one "seed" artist, then taking note of which
             tracks were recommended as well as why. For my analysis, while I found that Pandora did play songs with similar genres to the seed band, the tones of the tracks played varied; for instance, some
             tracks had a very upbeat sound to them, while others were more relaxed and perhaps even somber.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Project Showcase - CODIS Cold Case</h4>
           <p>This project takes a step into the field of forensics, showing how database technology can be used to help solve crime cases. For my project, I accessed the FBI's website to find a
              cold case that was solved with the help of database technology; eventually, I found a case where the IAFIS--a large database containing fingerprint scans alongside the names and other
              data of their respective owners--was used to close a murder case that had been unsolved for nearly 30 years.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Project Showcase - SQL</h4>
          <p>For this project, we were introduced to SQL and the basic commands that can be used to manipulate it. An example is shown here of some of the SELECT commands I learned how to use, completed using
          a tutorial on the W3Schools website.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

      <div class="main_section">
      <h3>Applications and E-mail</h3>
      <p>In this lesson, students are taught about the various applications and uses of computers. The uses of applications such as audio players, video players, e-mail and text messaging apps,
      and a few others are introduced alongside the basics of how they work, as well as various websites or web applications such as social media, streaming, and blog sites.</p>
      <br>
      <img src="OSINTActivity_IMG.PNG">
      <h4>Project Showcase - OSINT</h4>
          <p>This project involved creating a presentation that introduced the concept of Open-Source Intelligence, also called OSINT. Shown here is an example of one of the slides I created for
          my presentation, giving a basic description on what OSINT is and how it might be used.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

      <div class="main_section">
      <h3>Security Concepts</h3>
      <p>This lesson teaches about security issues relating to our daily use of computers. Various types of malware such as viruses, worms, trojans, and others are introduced, as well
      as ways to combat them such as careful usage of email applications and utilization of antivirus software. Other forms of security vulnerabilities are also discussed, including
      issues such as Denial of Service attacks and data breaches.</p>
      <br>
      <img src="SecurityInfographic_IMG.png">
      <h4>Project Showcase - Security Infographic</h4>
          <p>Similarly to the project completed in Lesson 3, this project involves creating an infographic to visually explain a concept; however, this infographic focuses on explaining
          a security-related concept instead.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

      <div class="main_section">
      <h3>The Internet</h3>
      <p>This lesson goes into more detail on the Internet and the World Wide Web. A wide variety of concepts are discussed in this lesson, such as different hardware components that
      enable Internet access, the importance of IP addresses in accessing and interacting with the Internet, and the functions of HTML and other website-related programming languages
      such as CSS and JavaScript.</p>
      <br>
      <img src="HTML_IMG.PNG">
      <h4>Project Showcase - HTML</h4>
          <p>The goal of this project was to use W3Schools' code editor to create a simple HTML and CSS site, incorporating text, images, and hyperlinks.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

      <div class="main_section">
      <h3>Privacy in a Digital World</h3>
      <p>In this lesson, the issue of privacy on the Internet is introduced. A discussion is given on why privacy and one's "digital footprint" is important, as well as how the
      database technologies mentioned earlier in Lesson 7 can cause issues for those wishing to maintain their privacy and anonymity over the Internet.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Project Showcase - What Do Companies Know About You?</h4>
          <p>For this project, students were tasked with exploring how much data companies can really collect on a person. Along with reflecting on social media use and what kinds of data
          may be transferred whenever one visits a social media post or makes their own, websites such as Whitepages were analyzed to see if any profiles have been created from the
          data gathered by companies. For my project, while I found that my attempts to avoid creating social media accounts did help in reducing the data that was available on me,
          I was surprised and intrigued to find that there were many profiles on others that had the same name as me.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

      <div class="main_section">
      <h3>IST and Society</h3>
      <p>In Lesson 12, the various societal issues IST can bring about are introduced. Concepts like the "digital divide," where financial and educational differences in a population
      can potentially limit access to some technology and create a divide between those who do have this access and those who are unable to do so, are explained. Additionally, the issue
      of cybercrime and how various aspects of the Internet such as anonymity can further complicate this issue is discussed in this lesson.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Project Showcase - Cybercrime</h4>
          <p>For this project, we were tasked with exploring some of the legal issues surrounding cybercrime. For my project, I aimed to answer the question of whether or not punishments for cybercrimes
          should be more severe for repeat offenders, to which I decided that the answer to this should depend on what kind of crime was committed. As cybercrime can range from activities such as an individual viewing
          illegal content on dark web sites to a large group carrying out a complex hack of a major corporation, more severe punishments for repeat offenders are more likely to deter those committing crimes that require
          less knowledge of computers as they do not have the experience to avoid being caught; however, severe punishments for repeat offenders may not be as effective for experienced hackers, who may instead respond
          by bolstering their knowledge to avoid detection.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

      <div class="main_section">
      <h3>IST and Businesses</h3>
      <p>Moving on from the societal dilemmas of IST, this lesson focuses on more business-related issues. For instance, the issue of copyright and how it can be complicated by various
      aspects of the Internet is discussed, as well as the pros and cons of various forms of work that can be conducted online including in-house work, outsourcing, and crowdsourcing.
      The lesson also gives a short history on a few major e-commerce sites, such as Amazon, Craigslist, and Alibaba.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Project Showcase - Crowdsourcing</h4>
          <p>For this discussion project, our goal was to explore crowdsourcing in more detail. For my project, I defined crowdsourcing and analyzed one particular field that has recently
          benefited significantly from crowdsourcing, that being the indie games industry. With the increasing popularity of indie games--video games made by smaller development teams--I found that crowdsourcing
          has become an increasingly attractive way for developers to refine their games, as a willing crowd can be very effective in quickly locating bugs as well as sharing feedback on what works and what doesn't
          in a game.</p>
